    "content": "It's hard to criticize Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, locking yourself into and staying faithful biopic while keeping it interesting is no mean feat as the general consensus is the movie is a masterpiece and the only criticism, I have found other than my own just seems to be one too many stars on the American flag. Each shot was beautifully composed as you would come to expect from the works of Nolan and his use of simultaneous unravelling plotlines kept what I’m sure are somewhat real events engaging. So far as the story is concerned, I appreciate the fact he looked at the mental strain and psychological implications in being responsible for killing so many. Despite feeling somewhat tacked onto the end it made Oppenheimer more personable, I also feel slightly conflicted about the latter quarter of the movie particularly with Robert Downey Jr’s character Lewis Strauss while vital to the plot and progressing the controversy Oppenheimer’s leftist views there was very little we knew about the character and didn’t feel like the antagonist he should have been made out to be. When it came to the great undoing of Strauss I feel it was not as satisfying as it should have been because of this leaving the viewer with a bit of a dry taste in their mouth after watching such a spectacle in the former half with a meandering ending. \nThe film made ingenious use of black and white to so show an object perspective as opposed to what Oppenheimer’s subjective elements, this made a clear distinction between his perspective to his objective wrong doings in the eyes of the government then going on to show the rivalry between himself and Strauss.\nWhen watching I couldn’t help but think about the one-dimensional view the movie was giving. The dropping of “Little Boy” and “Fat Man” were horrific and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths leading me to feel at times the movie was a little tone death to some of the consequences, which Is partly why I appreciated the psychological side of Oppenheimer having “blood on his hands”",
